<strong>70264 Booking POS Posting: Make the Cleanup function lock unfriendly</strong>
<ul><li>The Booking Posting POS cleanup () function made more lock efficient by checking if it is empty prior and also the search loop is not started in record locking mode.</li><li><b>Note:</b> This function should rarely write anything to the db.  It would be only in the cases where the POS created a reservation, but the user voided the lines. The reservation would not have any activities and the cleanup tries to delete the empty reservation.</li></ul>
